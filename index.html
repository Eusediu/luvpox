  <h1>LUVPOX Manifesto</h1>

  <p><strong>The world has been infected.</strong><br/>
  Not by computer viruses. Not by pandemics.  
  But by fear, by noise, by endless chasing of “more” that ends in “nothing.”</p>

  <p><strong>LUVPOX is the opposite.</strong><br/>
  A good virus. A lucid love plague.  
  A manifesto that asks for no permission. No login. No cookies.</p>

  <p>It’s for the ones who still feel.  
  Who haven’t outsourced their heart to the cloud.  
  Who still cry for innocent children dying in forgotten wars.  
  Who ache for every country crushed by the weight of another’s ambition.  
  Who pause for the elderly with barely $100 a month and no one to hold their hand.  
  Who know they’re not perfect—but try not to be indifferent.</p>

  <p>It’s for those who:  
  <ul>
    <li>believe a hug can reboot a soul.</li>
    <li>sat in silence and felt more alive than in a thousand meetings.</li>
    <li>know AI isn’t the real threat. The real threat is the absence of A and I: Affection. Integrity.</li>
  </ul></p>

  <p><strong>LUVPOX sells nothing. Asks for nothing.</strong><br/>
  But it offers this:  
  A space. A breath. A mirror with no beauty filter.</p>

  <div class="cta">
    <p><strong>LOVE.<br/>
    BE HUMAN.<br/>
    SPREAD IT.</strong></p>

    <p>And if something tightens in your chest...  
    welcome.  
    You’re already infected.</p>
  </div>
